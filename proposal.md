    1. Explore HCAHPS Question score on map

    2. how many tweets per city, ranked by population or categorized by city/rural/suburban or ranked by population ratio within the state
        - visualize # vs. population(etc.)

    3. hospital (# or per capita #) per city, ranked by population or categorized by city/rural/suburban or ranked by population ratio within the state
        - visualize rating/surbey results vs. per capita value

    4. compare twitter sentiments to patient experience survey per city, ranked by population or categorized by city/rural/suburban or ranked by population ratio within the state
        - visualize diff vs. population(etc.)

    5. Potentially, time series analyiss of how the survey rating and the twitter score changes over time

- Research Questions to Answer

    Is there compelling relationship between hospital experience survey rating and twitter setiment score in order to use twitter data as complementary to survey data?

    Specifically,

    1. How does city size affects # of tweets of hospital experience?
